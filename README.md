# project_1

As the Austin population is booming every day, and people want to have fun things to do, we came up with the idea that having multiple event finders for the population would give them more options to make their choices from and more certainty on the reliability of events. This is why we have decided to create “WhatDo”, by bringing local events closer to you, than ever before. We believe, that as newbies into the development industry, we have been on the other side of the door and know the demand for these things. Now that we are acquiring skills through this bootcamp we can be part of the solution.

WhatDo is a local events finder which is launched only in Austin for the time being. It is a tool that will be very useful for Austinites as the city is known for its youth that seeks memorable and fun things to do mostly everyday. We would like WhatDo to be accessible to everyone old enough to browse the internet and go out. We have also made our app user friendly no matter your device type.

User Story:
AS AN individual who is bored
I WANT to find events in my area
SO THAT I can have fun

We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to create our application.
The framework of our web app was done with Flexbox mainly. For our API’s we used the ticketmaster API, Google maps API, and SongKick API.
We have one main page, a map page were the events will be listed, and a search result page, which will be prompted  whenever  the search button is clicked.
